--Q.4) Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to find all product_id with total sales

--Q.8)Simulate a "loyalty program" by assigning a customer_id to transactions based on a random distribution (e.g., customer IDs range from 1â€“1000).

--Q.9) Partition the transactions into three groups:
--Group 1: Total Bill in the bottom 25% of all transactions.
--Group 2: Total Bill in the middle 50%.
--Group 3: Total Bill in the top 25%. For each group,
--calculate the average unit_price and transaction_qty.

--Q.10)Analyze sales patterns by identifying the combination of Day Name and 
--Hour with the highest sales (Total Bill) for each product category. Include ties, if any.
